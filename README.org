My scripts and tiny programs for Emacs.

  - [[file:extract-string-from-webpage.el][extract-string-from-webpage.el]] - retrieve a webpage and return all occurrences of a regexp; usage: read the docstrings by doing
    - =M-x load-file=
    - =extract-string-from-webpage.el RET=
    - =C-h f teletype-in-new-buffer RET=
    or you may also see a short demo with =M-x teletype-run-demo RET= 
  - [[file:string-list-composer.el][string-list-composer.el]] - sum and product of string lists; usage: load it with =M-x load-file RET C-h f slc/insert RET=
  - [[file:teletype/teletype.el][teletype.el]] - teletype-like printing function for Emacs; usage: read the docstrings by doing =M-x load-file RET C-h f teletype-in-new-buffer RET=; you may also see a short demo with =M-x teletype-run-demo= 
  - [[file:japanese-furigana/furigana-example.org][furigana-example.org]] - an example Org file to write Japanese text and optionally put furigana signs over kanji; I provided also the expected [[file:japanese-furigana/furigana-example.pdf?raw=true][PDF output]] and [[file:japanese-furigana/furigana-example.html?raw=true][HTML output source]] of the Org example; due to a GitHub limitation you can't see the rendered HTML output online, but you may download the HTML file and open it locally with your browser
  - [[file:learnjap/learnjap.el][learnjap.el]] - tells you the meaning and pronounciation of every kanji! download the =.el= files, load them with =M-x load-file RET learnjap.el RET= and read the docstrings with =C-f learnjap/show-learnjap-info RET=; TODO: add hiragana and katakana support
