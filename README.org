My scripts and snippets for Emacs:

- [[extract-string-from-webpage.el][extract-string-from-webpage.el]] - retrieve a webpage and return all occurrences of a regexp
- [[string-list-composer.el][string-list-composer.el]] - sum and product of string lists;
  you use it by loading it with =load-file= and call the interactive-function =slc/insert=
  (better explanations are on the way)
- [[teletype/teletype.el][teletype.el]] - teletype-like printing function for Emacs; see the top
  of teletype.el for some usage explanations
- [[japanese-furigana/furigana-example.org][furigana-example.org]] - an example Org file
   to write Japanese text and optionally put furigana signs over kanji; I provided also 
   the expected [[japanese-furigana/furigana-example.pdf?raw=true][PDF output]] 
   and [[japanese-furigana/furigana-example.html?raw=true][HTML output (note that you must download it to see it)]] of the Org example
