I tried to catch the chips off guard, 
and pressed again, but twice as hard.
I pleaded with the cursed machine: 
I begged and cried and then I swore.

Now in mighty desperation, 
trying random combinations,
Still there came the incantation, 
just as senseless as before.

Cursor blinking, angrily winking, 
blinking nonsense as before.
Reading, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"
