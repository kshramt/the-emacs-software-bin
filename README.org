My scripts and tiny programs for Emacs.

  - [[file:extract-string-from-webpage.el][extract-string-from-webpage.el]] - retrieve a webpage and return all occurrences of a regexp; usage: read the docstrings by doing
    - =M-x load-file=
    - =extract-string-from-webpage.el RET=
    - =C-h f extract-string-from-webpage RET=
  - [[file:string-list-composer.el][string-list-composer.el]] - sum and product of string lists; usage: load it with =M-x load-file RET C-h f slc/insert RET=
  - [[file:teletype/teletype.el][teletype.el]] - teletype-like printing function for Emacs; usage instructions in the docstring:
    - =M-x load-file RET=
    - =C-h f teletype-in-new-buffer RET=
    you may also see a short demo with =M-x teletype-run-demo= 
  - [[file:japanese-furigana/furigana-example.org][furigana-example.org]] - an example Org file to write Japanese text and optionally put furigana signs over kanji; I provided also the [[file:japanese-furigana/furigana-example.pdf?raw=true][expected PDF output]] and [[file:japanese-furigana/furigana-example.html?raw=true][source of expected HTML output]] of the Org example; due to a GitHub limitation you can't see the rendered HTML output online, but you may download the HTML file and open it locally with your browser
  - [[file:learnjap/learnjap.el][learnjap.el]] - tells you the meaning and readings of a kanji, and reading of hiragana/katakana; download the =.el= files in the [[file:learnjap][learnjap directory]], load them with =M-x load-file RET learnjap.el RET= and read the docstrings with =C-h f learnjap/show-learnjap-info RET=
  - [[file:include_all_org_files/include_all_org_files.el][include_all_org_files.el]] - an Org Babel block that adds =#+INCLUDE:= tags for all the =.org= files of a directory
